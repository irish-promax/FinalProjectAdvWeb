<br>Final Project

<br>Project:
Final Year Project (FYP) is a compulsory course for all CCI diploma and degree programs. To graduate, students need to at least pass FYP course. In CCI, FYP coordinator is responsible in managing FYP matters. To improve efficiency and productivity in managing and coordinating FYP, a web-based system has been proposed.

<br>Study the business requirements below:

<br>Each FYP project can be categorized as either development project or research project.

<br>Each project shall be developed by one student. Each project shall have one supervisor and two examiners among CCI lecturers. A lecturer can supervise many projects and can also become examiners to other projects. Each project shall have a title, start date, end date, duration (in month), project’s progress and project status. A project’s progress is represented by: Milestone 1, Milestone 2 and Final Report. A project’s status is indicated by: On track, Delayed, Extended, Completed.
In a common setup, the FYP coordinator will create a project and assign to student, supervisor and two examiners. Supervisor will update the project details including project start date, end date, project progress and project status.
